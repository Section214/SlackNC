SlackNC is (being) designed to be a powerful, user-friendly command-line client for Slack. Why? Because it was recently brought to my attention that there aren't any good CLI clients for Slack, I use Slack daily, and I love CLI. Besides... I've been teaching myself Node.JS and it seemed like an amusing project!

## Npm Installation

`npm install slacknc`

## Git Installation

1. You can clone the GitHub repository: `https://github.com/Section214/SlackNC.git`
